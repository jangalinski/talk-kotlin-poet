# Kotlin Meta Programming

###  Code Generation with Kotlin Poet

---

## Abstract

<small>AI code generation is a challenge for our daily work. But do we want to rely on some chat comments for 
professional software development? There must be a middle way between manual coding and c&p from the internet. 
Luckily there is: meta-programming. In short: write software that writes software. 
We will have a look at practical implementations using the Kotlin Poet language model lib and maven 
plugin infrastructure.</small> 

Let there be code.

* [kotlin poet](https://square.github.io/kotlinpoet/) - KotlinPoet is a Kotlin and Java API for generating .kt source files. Source file generation can be useful when doing things such as annotation processing or interacting with metadata files (e.g., database schemas, protocol formats). By generating code, you eliminate the need to write boilerplate while also keeping a single source of truth for the metadata.
